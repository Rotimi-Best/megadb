# MegaDB - Monitor Lecture Halls by Viewing, Adding hall info and Creating New Activities.
Source of this Idea:
I realized that in my university when a lecturer comes for a class he would usually go to the duty officer that keeps the keys to 
all the lecture halls in the university, then the lecturer tells the duty officer the hall he is going to and writes it in a book the hall number, his/her name and a signature then after his/her lecture the lecturer returns the key and signs one more time that
the key has been returned. This was an ineffective method for me in the sense where the duty officer has to go through pages in order to know if a key has been taking, once the book used in registering it is lost all the information is gone, this is the 21st century and for such kind of information using a book is not the best approach so I decided to created this project.

About the project:
This project is a web application that help my university monitor how teachers have access to the lecture halls in the university. 
Using PHP as the backend language. There are two major users one the administrator and the sub-administrator. The administrator
can add new sub administrators, add new teachers, add new activities(an activity could mean a teacher taking the key to a hall or
returning the key), add new halls, delete activities, view activities, statistics, teachers and all halls in the university while the sub administrator
can view and add new activities, view teachers, and view all statistics. 

Statistics consists of the following:
1. Free lecture halls. 2. Busy lecture halls. 3. Teachers who havn't returned the key. 4. Largest hall. 5. Smallest hall.
